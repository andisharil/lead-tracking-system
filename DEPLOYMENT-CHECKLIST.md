- [ ] Seed initial data (if needed)

### 5. Storage and Links
- [ ] Create storage symbolic link: `php artisan storage:link`
- [ ] Verify file upload directories exist
- [ ] Test file upload functionality

### 6. Web Server Configuration
- [ ] Configure virtual host/server block
- [ ] Enable SSL/HTTPS
- [ ] Set up HTTPS redirects
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Test web server configuration
