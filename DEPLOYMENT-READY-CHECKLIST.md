# 2. Build production caches
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan optimize

# 3. Run migrations (if needed)
php artisan migrate --force

# 4. Create storage link (if needed)
php artisan storage:link

# 5. Set proper permissions
chmod -R 755 storage bootstrap/cache
```
