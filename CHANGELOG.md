## 2025-10-04 - Vercel Deployment Fix: Build Output Directory

### What changed (non-technical language)
- We fixed the deployment error on Vercel that said ‚ÄúNo Output Directory named ‚Äòdist‚Äô found.‚Äù
- Vercel was looking for a folder named ‚Äúdist‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt exist in this project.
- Our app builds its frontend files into `public/build`, not `dist`.

### Exactly what we did
- Updated the Vercel settings file to:
  - Tell Vercel to run the frontend build step (`npm run build`).
  - Tell Vercel that the built files will be in `public/build`.
- This ensures Vercel finds the right files after building and can serve the app correctly.

### Files changed
- Updated `vercel.json`:
  - Added `"outputDirectory": "public/build"`
  - Added `"buildCommand": "npm run build"`

### Why this matters
- Without this fix, Vercel doesn‚Äôt know where the built files are and fails the deployment.
- With this update, deployments should succeed and your app will be available online.
